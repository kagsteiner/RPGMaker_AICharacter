# Backlog

* Groundwork for an eval - store all prompts + output in a file for analyzing
* Fix the issue that dialog of an NPC giving you something is not correctly word wrapped
* Weapons and armor support. Probably most RPGs want that. Although I believe it is much less important once you can really interact
* support chatting between NPCs, with lightweight dialog that just shows the text for a number of seconds
* fix the issue that you cannot reuse variables that mark goal success
* Re-think the new feature of chatting to every event - should exclude non-NPC-events, but how?
* Continue and publish nice example game, learning on the way
* Can a Event move to a different level?

(not sorted at all, I do what I find most fun first :-) )
