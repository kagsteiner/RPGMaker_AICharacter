# Backlog

1. support chatting between NPCs, with lightweight dialog that just shows the text for a number of seconds
2. fix the issue that you cannot reuse variables that mark goal success
3. Fix the issue that dialog of an NPC giving you something is not correctly word wrapped
4. Re-think the new feature of chatting to every event - should exclude non-NPC-events, but how?
5. Groundwork for an eval - store all prompts + output in a file for analyzing
